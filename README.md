## About Me
Nathan Douieb, 24-year-old, student in my third year of industrial engineering, specializing in information systems. Presently, I work as a Data Analyst at the Ministry of Employment. I have been passionate about Python since the day I discovered the first lines of code. I can consider myself a pythonista (like geeks
like to say it)

Then, in the infinite world of Python into which I immersed myself, I discovered other worlds. The world of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Temporal Analysis Series, Data analysis of all kinds and in all forms.
